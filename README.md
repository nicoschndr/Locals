# Locals-IP2

This is a project built with JavaScript, npm, TypeScript, and React. It is designed to help locals find events and activities in their area.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en/.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can clone the project repository from GitHub:

```

After cloning the repository, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

## Running the App

To run the app, you can use Expo. Expo is a toolchain that makes it easy to develop, build, and deploy React Native apps. You can install Expo globally using npm:

```
npm install -g expo-cli
```

Once you have Expo installed, you can start the app by running:

```
expo start
```

This will start the Metro bundler and open the Expo DevTools in your default browser. From here, you can run the app on an iOS or Android simulator, or on your own device using the Expo Go app.

To run the app on an iOS simulator, you will need to have Xcode installed on your machine. To run the app on an Android simulator, you will need to have Android Studio installed on your machine.

You can also run the app on your own device using the Expo Go app. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Download the Expo Go app from the App Store or Google Play Store.

## Using the App

Once you have the app running, you can use it to find events and activities in your area. The app will display a list of categories, such as "Concert", "Culture", and "Sports". You can select a category to see a list of events in that category.

Each event in the list will display the event name, date, time, location, and a brief description. You can tap on an event to view more details about it.

On the event details screen, you can see the event name, date, time, location, and a longer description. You can also see a map of the event location and get directions to the event using your device's maps app.

If you're interested in attending the event, you can mark it as a favorite by tapping the heart icon. This will add the event to your favorites list, which you can access from the app's main menu.

In addition to browsing events by category, you can also search for events by keyword. Simply enter a keyword in the search bar at the top of the screen, and the app will display a list of events that match your search.

The app also includes several other screens that you can use to explore events and activities in your area. These include:

- **Map**: This screen displays a map of your current location, with pins indicating nearby events and activities. You can tap on a pin to view more details about the event, or use the search bar to filter the results.

- **Chatbot**: This screen allows you to chat with a virtual assistant that can help you find events and activities in your area. Simply type in your question or request, and the chatbot will provide you with a response.

- **Yell**: This screen allows you to post messages to a public message board. You can use this feature to ask for recommendations, share your thoughts on events and activities, or connect with other users.

- **Profile**: This screen displays your user profile, where you can view your created events, your activity history, and access your friends list to message other users within the Locals community. You can also edit your profile information and settings.

- **Post**: This screen allows you to create a post to share with other users and with the whole Locals community. After creating a post, you can view it on the Yell screen.

- **Create Event**: This screen allows you to create an event to share with other users and with the whole Locals community. You can include text, images, and a location to your event, and choose whether to make it public or visible only to your friends. After creating an event, other users can find in on the map and the explore screen.

- **Event Detail**: This screen displays detailed information about an event, including the event name, date, time, location, and a longer description. You can also see a map of the event location and get directions to the event using your device's maps app. If you're interested you can also leave a comment on the event to plan with other users or event related ask questions.

- **Friends List**: This screen displays a list of your friends on the app. You can tap on a friend to view their profile, or use the search bar to find a specific friend. If you tap on a user you can open the chat with them and start a conversation.

Finally, if you have any feedback or suggestions for the app, you can submit them using the feedback form in the app's main menu. We're always looking for ways to improve the app and make it more useful for our users.

We hope you enjoy using the app to discover new events and activities in your area! If you have any questions or issues, please feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
